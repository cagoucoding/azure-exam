## Different cloud models

| Public                                | Private                                           | Hybrid                            |
|  ---                                  |   ---                                             |  ---                              |
| * over public Internet                | * on-premises                                     | * combined                        |
| * easily scalable                     | * hardware must be purchased                      | * more flexible                   |
| * quick app provision / deprovision   | * complete control over resources and security    | * choose where app run            |
| * pay-as-you-go                       | * maintenance hardware and security               | * control security, compliance    |

## Cloud benefits

1. Advantages
    - High availability  
    - Scalabitily  
    - Eslaticity  
    - Agility  
    - Geo-distribution  
    - Disaster recovery  

2. Expenses

    - Capital Expenditure (CapEx): up-front cost for physical infra for example  

    - Operational Expenditure (OpEx): expense for services or products and deductable now - Consumption-based model

Cloud computing is a consumption-based model
