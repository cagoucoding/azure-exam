# Explore Azure compute services

## Overview of Azure compute services  

It is an on-demand computing service for running cloud-based applications.  
It provides computing resources such as disks, processors, memory, networking, and operating systems.  

Most prominent services are:

- Azure Virtual Machines: software emulations of physical computers, including:  
  - virtual processor  
  - memory  
  - storage  
  - networking  
  - hosting OS  

- Virtual Machine Scale Sets: sets of identitcal VMS designed to support autoscaling (scale up/down).  

- Azure Container Instances/ Kubernetes Services: compute resources that you can use to deploy and manage containers.

- Azure App Service: you can quickly build, deploy, and scale enterprise-grade web, mobile, and API apps running on any platform.  

- Azure Functions: ideal when you're concerned only about the code running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure.  

## Azure Virtual Machines  

Ideal for:  

- Total control over the operating system (OS).  
- The ability to run custom software.  
- To use custom hosting configurations.  

Examples of use cases:  

- During testing and development  
- When running applications in the cloud  
- When extending your datacenter to the cloud  
- During disaster recovery
